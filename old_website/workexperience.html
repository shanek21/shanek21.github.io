									<h2>Olin College of Engineering: 3D Printing Research</h2>
									<p>Myself and a team of three others help oversee the use of the campus-wide 3D printers, help students get the most out of 3D printing, and conduct research in the field of 3D printing. My specific area of research is on fused deposition modeling and the discrepancies between the virtual 3D model that is submitted to a 3D printer and the physical plastic object that comes out of the printer.</p>

									<h2>National Oilwell Varco: Product Design</h2>
									<p>I had the opportunity to participate in a week long super charged internship experience at NOV during my senior year of high school. I was able to dive immediately into the product design process alongside current mechanical engineers. NOV asked a team of 3 other interns and me to redesign an existing product (though they asked us to do this without telling us that the product already existed) to see if we could come up with something more effective. Turns out that we came up with the same design that their professional engineers came up with! Pretty cool!</p>
