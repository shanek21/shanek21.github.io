							<h2>Mobius Gear Strip</h2>
							<p>I am currently working on creating a fully functioning, 3D printed, servo driven Mobius gear strip. In order to get the Mobius strip to both spin around and rotate along its circular axis, I am going to use helical planetary gear bearings that I custom design. If I can get it to fully function, then it would be a very exciting proof of the power of 3D printing!</p>

							<h2>Arduino-Enabled LED Lighting</h2>
							<p>As a side project, and as an attempt to spruce up my boring room, my roommate and I put 60 feet of LED lighting around our ceiling. The LED strips are powered by a custom power adapter and controlled by an Arduino Uno. These 'smart' LEDs turn on when the room is too dark, have multiple color patterns, and can be interfaced with by an infrared remote and infrared sensor embedded in the Arduino circuit.</p>

							<h2>Self-Replicating Code</h2>
							<p>Using Java, I wrote code that is able to take control of your keyboard and mouse. The code then begins using parts of itself to write new Java project files and effectively duplicates itself. Is it useful? Maybe. Is it cool? Yes!</p>
