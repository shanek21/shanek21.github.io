						<h2>Mobius Gear Strip</h2>
						<p>I am currently working on creating a fully functioning, 3D printed, servo driven Mobius gear strip. In order to get the Mobius strip to both spin around and rotate along its circular axis, I am going to use helical planeary gear bearings that I custom design. If I can get it to function fully, then it would be a very exciting proof to the power of 3D printing!</p>

						<h2>MegaBots Robotic Arm Design</h2>
						<p>MegaBots, a comapny who's dream is to see giant bipedal robots fight in an arena with large paintball-based weapons, has recently issued a design challenge to the community. A friends and I took up that challenge.</p>

						<h2>National Oilwell Varco: Product Design</h2>

						<h2>Self-Replicating Code</h2>
						<p>Using Java, I wrote code that is able to take over control of your keyboard and mouse. The code then begins using parts of itself to write new Java project files and effectively duplicates itself. Is it useful? Maybe. Is it cool? Yes!</p>
