					<h1>About me.</h1>
					<p>Throughout my high school career I designed and built robots for multiple competitive events, used CAD software to participate in technical drafting competitions, and entered many areas of engineering. Since attending Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering, I have delved deeper into my passions for engineering. I am taking classes in design, software, electronics, and mechanics, which provide the foundation for my engineering knowledge and will help me acheive my goal of a robotics engineering degree. You can navigate to the Work Experience or Projects tabs to look at some of the work that I have done recently.</p>
